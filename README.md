# Angular : Encryption and Decryption using CryptoJS
Let's cover both AES (symmetric key) and RSA (asymmetric key) encryption/decryption in Angular 19.
The most common and lightweight approach is using CryptoJS (AES or RSA isn't built into Angular directly).

### 🔹 Option 1: AES (Symmetric Key) - Fast & Simple

    -   Example is CryptoJS.
    -   One secret key for both encrypt & decrypt.
    -   Good for payload encryption inside your Angular app.
    -   ⚠️ Key management is critical (should not be hardcoded).

### 🔹 Option 2: RSA (Asymmetric Key) - Public/Private Keys

For stronger security (e.g., encrypt with a public key in Angular and decrypt on server with private key), we can use node-forge.

## Encryption and Decryption in angular | crypto-js
With Angular, we have crypto-js, RSA encryption like so many libraies. You have to choose you library depends on the Backend you have. From Frontend, you are sending the encrypted data which need to decrept from backend. 
RSA encryption works with Angular & .Net both. Whatever the encryption you done on the angular side, same encrypted data they can decrypt on the .Net side as well because same algorithm.

```
npm install crypto-js - save 
npm install - save-dev @types/crypto-js
```

✅ AES → Good for local/session data encryption.
✅ RSA → Best for client → server secure payloads.


## Realtime Scenarios for Encryption & Decryption
### 🔐 1. Authentication & Login Systems    
**Scenario:** When a user logs into a banking or e-commerce app.    
**Usage:**      
    -   Passwords are encrypted (hashed + salted) before storage.
    -   During login, the entered password is encrypted in the same way and compared with the stored hash.

### 📧 2. Secure Communication (Emails, Messaging Apps)     
**Scenario:** Sending confidential information via Gmail, WhatsApp, or Signal.  
**Usage:**      
    -   Messages are encrypted end-to-end, so only the sender and receiver can decrypt them.
    -   Even service providers cannot read the content.

### 💳 3. Payment Transactions      
**Scenario:** Making an online purchase with a credit card. 
**Usage: **     
    -   Card details are encrypted before being sent to the payment gateway.
    -   The payment gateway decrypts it to process the transaction securely.

### 🏥 4. Healthcare Data Protection (HIPAA Compliance)     
**Scenario:** Hospitals storing patient health records in the cloud.    
**Usage:**    
    -   Patient data is encrypted before being stored.
    -   Only authorized doctors with decryption keys can view the records.

### ☁️ 5. Cloud Storage & File Sharing      
**Scenario:** Uploading files to Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive.    
**Usage:**      
    -   Files are encrypted before upload.
    -   When downloaded, the files are decrypted for the user.

### 🏦 6. Banking & Financial Applications      
**Scenario:** Accessing net banking or mobile banking apps.     
**Usage:**      
    -   Sensitive data like OTP, account number, and transactions are encrypted during transmission.
    -   Banks decrypt the information securely on their servers.

### 🌍 7. VPNs & Secure Browsing        
**Scenario:** Accessing a website using HTTPS or a VPN.     
**Usage:**      
    -   Data between browser and server is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
    -   Prevents hackers from intercepting login details or sensitive info.

### 🏢 8. Enterprise Applications       
**Scenario:** Internal communication in a company (Slack, Teams, internal APIs).        
**Usage:**      
    -   API payloads are encrypted before sending over the network.
    -   The receiving system decrypts them for further processing.

### 📱 9. Mobile Apps (Offline Data Security)       
**Scenario:** A mobile banking app storing transaction history offline.     
**Usage:**          
    -   Data stored in local storage/SQLite is encrypted.
    -   Only the app (with keys) can decrypt it, not other malicious apps.

### 🛂 10. Government & Defense     
**Scenario:** Sending classified military or diplomatic documents.      
**Usage:**       
    -   Data is encrypted using advanced algorithms (AES, RSA).
    -   Only authorized recipients with proper decryption keys can access it.
